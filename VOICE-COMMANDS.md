## Tips

### For Best Voice Recognition
1. **Speak clearly** but naturally
2. **Quiet environment** helps
3. **Headset microphone** works best
4. **Watch the voice meter** - speak when it's bouncing

### For Long Narrations
1. **Start narration** - Let it read
2. **Use ◀️/▶️** to navigate while paused
3. **Say "Skip"** to jump ahead
4. **Say "Pause"** to stop and resume later

### Keyboard vs Voice
- **Keyboard** - Faster for experienced IF players
- **Voice** - More immersive, hands-free
- **Mix both** - Use what feels natural!

# Text Highlighting System - Temporary Marker Implementation

## Status: ✅ STABLE - All major bugs resolved

**Last Updated:** December 16, 2024 - Fixed upper window highlighting and whitespace issues

## Overview

The temporary marker system preserves original HTML formatting while enabling accurate TTS highlighting. It works by inserting temporary Unicode markers (`⚐N⚐`) at potential chunk boundaries, then determining which markers survive text processing to create the final chunk boundaries.

**Key Innovation:** The split regex was designed to preserve markers within chunks while splitting at the boundaries, solving the critical issue where markers were being removed during the split operation.

## Architecture Note

**Code has been modularized** (as of December 2024). The highlighting system is now split across multiple ES6 modules instead of a monolithic `app.js`:

- `public/js/narration/chunking.js` - Marker insertion and chunk creation
- `public/js/narration/highlighting.js` - CSS Highlight API integration
- `public/js/ui/game-output.js` - Lazy chunking and content rendering
- `public/js/utils/text-processing.js` - Text transformations and sentence splitting

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Insert Temporary Markers in HTML

**Function:** `insertTemporaryMarkers(html)` in `chunking.js` (line 15)

Insert temporary markers (`⚐0⚐`, `⚐1⚐`, etc.) at ALL potential chunk boundaries:

1. **Paragraph breaks:** `⚐N⚐<br><br>` - Marker BEFORE `<br><br>`
   - `<br><br>` becomes `. ` during processing → creates sentence boundary

2. **Sentence endings:** `text.⚐N⚐` - Marker AFTER `.!?`
   - Only when followed by space/tag/end-of-string
   - Skips initials (H.P., U.S.) using negative lookbehind `/(?<![A-Z])/`

**Example:**
```
Original: "Hello.<br><br>World! How are you?"
Marked:   "Hello.⚐0⚐<br><br>World!⚐1⚐ How are you?⚐2⚐"
```

### Step 2: Process to Plain Text

**Function:** `createNarrationChunks(html)` in `chunking.js` (line 60)

1. Strip HTML tags (keep markers): `<br><br>` → `. `, `<br>` → ` `
2. Apply TTS processing: Collapse spaced capitals, normalize initials, title case
   - "A N C H O R H E A D" → "Anchorhead"
   - "H.P." → "HP"
3. Markers move with the text during transformations

**Example:**
```
After processing: "Hello.⚐0⚐. World!⚐1⚐ How are you?⚐2⚐"
```

### Step 3: Split into Chunks (Critical!)

**Function:** `splitIntoSentences(processedText)` in `text-processing.js` (line 48)

**Split regex:** `/(?<=⚐\d+⚐)\s+|(?<=[.!?])(?!⚐)\s+/`

This regex has TWO patterns:
1. `(?<=⚐\d+⚐)\s+` - Split AFTER marker+space (keeps marker in chunk)
2. `(?<=[.!?])(?!⚐)\s+` - Split after punctuation+space ONLY when NOT followed by marker

**Why this matters:**
- Pattern 1 ensures markers END UP IN THE CHUNKS (not consumed by split)
- Pattern 2 handles punctuation WITHOUT markers (e.g., mid-sentence periods that survived)
- Together: Markers stay attached to chunks, enabling extraction

**Example:**
```
Split: ["Hello.⚐0⚐.", "World!⚐1⚐", "How are you?⚐2⚐"]
       └─ marker 0   └─ marker 1   └─ marker 2
```

### Step 4: Extract Marker IDs from Chunks

Each chunk is parsed to extract its marker ID:
- Regex `/⚐(\d+)⚐/` finds marker at end of chunk
- Last chunk has no marker (expected behavior)
- Returns array: `[{text: "Hello.", markerID: 0, index: 0}, ...]`

**Example:**
```javascript
[
  {text: "Hello.", markerID: 0, index: 0},
  {text: "World!", markerID: 1, index: 1},
  {text: "How are you?", markerID: 2, index: 2}
]
```

### Step 5: Replace Temp Markers with DOM Elements

**Function:** `insertRealMarkersAtIDs(container, markerIDs)` in `chunking.js` (line 100)

For each surviving marker ID:
1. Find the `⚐N⚐` marker in the DOM (using TreeWalker on text nodes)
2. Replace with TWO invisible `<span>` elements:
   - `<span class="chunk-marker-end" data-chunk="N">` - Marks END of chunk N
   - `<span class="chunk-marker-start" data-chunk="N+1">` - Marks START of chunk N+1

**Special case:** Manually insert `<span class="chunk-marker-start" data-chunk="0">` at the very beginning (no temp marker exists there)

**Marker mapping:**
- Chunk 0: start[0] ... end[0], start[1]
- Chunk 1: end[1], start[2]
- Chunk 2: end[2], start[3]
- ...
- Chunk N (last): start[N] ... (no end marker)

### Step 6: Clean Up Temporary Markers

**Function:** `removeTemporaryMarkers(container, chunks)` in `chunking.js` (line 193)

- Walk all text nodes and remove any remaining `⚐N⚐` patterns
- Ensures clean DOM for display

### Step 7: Highlight During TTS

**Function:** `highlightUsingMarkers(chunkIndex)` in `highlighting.js` (line 16)

To highlight chunk N:
1. Query DOM: `.chunk-marker-start[data-chunk="${N}"]` and `.chunk-marker-end[data-chunk="${N}"]`
2. Create Range from `setStartAfter(startMarker)` to `setEndBefore(endMarker)`
3. Apply CSS Highlight API: `CSS.highlights.set('speaking', range)`
4. Last chunk: Highlight to end of container (no end marker exists)

---

## Key Insights

### 1. HTML structure ≠ Processed text structure

**Original HTML:**
```html
"-- H.P. Lovecraft</span><br><br>A N C H O R H E A D"
```

**After processing:**
```
"-- HP Lovecraft. Anchorhead."
```

Text transformations create/remove sentence boundaries. Markers must survive these transformations.

### 2. The Split Regex is Critical

**Problem:** Simple regex `/(?<=[.!?])\s+/` would split at "`.⚐7⚐ `" but REMOVE the marker (it's part of the delimiter).

**Solution:** `/(?<=⚐\d+⚐)\s+|(?<=[.!?])(?!⚐)\s+/` splits at the SPACE while keeping markers intact.

**Result:** "text.⚐7⚐ next" → ["text.⚐7⚐", "next"] ✓ (marker preserved)

### 3. Chunk Authority

- Chunk creation is the single source of truth
- Can't predict boundaries until after full text processing
- Only markers that survive processing create DOM boundaries

### 4. Marker Placement Strategy

- Punctuation: Marker AFTER (`.⚐N⚐`)
- Paragraph breaks: Marker BEFORE (`⚐N⚐<br><br>`)
- This ensures markers are adjacent to the text they should group with

### 5. Last Chunk Behavior

- Expected: No marker at end of final chunk
- Highlighting: Uses start marker + end of container

## Example Flow (Anchorhead Opening)

**Original HTML:**
```html
<span>The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind</span>
<span>is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind</span>
<span>of fear is fear of the unknown.</span><br/><br/>
<span>-- H.P. Lovecraft</span><br/><br/>
<span>A N C H O R H E A D</span>
```

**After insertTemporaryMarkers():**
```
14 delimiters found:
[0] <br><br> at "unknown.</span>⚐0⚐<br><br>"
[1] <br><br> at "Lovecraft</span>⚐1⚐<br><br>"
[2] <br><br> at "H E A D</span>⚐2⚐<br><br>"
[3] "." at "unknown.⚐3⚐</span>"
...
```

**After processing + split:**
```
7 chunks created:
Chunk 0: "November, 1997." (marker 0)
Chunk 1: "You take a deep breath...Anchorhead." (marker 1)
Chunk 2: "Squinting up...happen so fast. The strange phone call...life..." (marker 2)
Chunk 3: "Now suddenly here you are...starting to rain." (marker 3)
Chunk 4: "These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted." (marker 4)
Chunk 5: "You shake yourself...settling in." (marker 5)
Chunk 6: "A sullen belch...you open your umbrella." (marker 6)
```

**DOM structure:**
```html
<div class="game-text">
  <span class="chunk-marker-start" data-chunk="0"></span>
  November, 1997.
  <span class="chunk-marker-end" data-chunk="0"></span>
  <span class="chunk-marker-start" data-chunk="1"></span>
  <br><br>
  You take a deep breath...
  <span class="chunk-marker-end" data-chunk="1"></span>
  <span class="chunk-marker-start" data-chunk="2"></span>
  ...
</div>
```

## New Features (December 2024)

### Lazy Chunking System

**Function:** `ensureChunksReady()` in `game-output.js` (line 19)

The system now uses **lazy evaluation** for chunk creation:

1. **When text is added:** `addGameText()` just renders HTML, doesn't create chunks
2. **When narration starts:** `ensureChunksReady()` creates chunks on-demand
3. **Benefits:**
   - Faster rendering (no upfront chunking cost)
   - Only chunk when actually needed
   - Reduces wasted computation for non-narrated text

**Validation flag:** `state.chunksValid` tracks whether chunks need regeneration

### Status Line + Main Content Handling

The system now processes **both status line and main game text**:

1. **Status line chunks come first** (indices 0, 1, 2...)
2. **Main content chunks follow** (indices N, N+1, N+2...)
3. **Chunk offset logic:** Main content marker IDs are adjusted by status line chunk count
   - Example: If status has 4 chunks, main content markers `⚐0⚐`, `⚐1⚐` become `⚐4⚐`, `⚐5⚐`
4. **Start markers inserted at beginning of BOTH containers** for proper highlighting

**Key function:** Lines 44-104 in `game-output.js` handle the two-container chunking flow

---

## Bug Fixes History

### Fix #1 - Marker Selector Logic (2025-12-14)

**Problem:** Highlighting function was using wrong selectors for System 1 markers.

**Solution:** Updated `highlightUsingMarkers()` to use correct selectors:
- Both start and end markers for chunk N have `data-chunk="N"`
- Start: `.chunk-marker-start[data-chunk="${chunkIndex}"]`
- End: `.chunk-marker-end[data-chunk="${chunkIndex}"]`

### Fix #2 - ReferenceError Bug (2025-12-14)

**Problem:** Referenced undefined variable `currentNarrationChunks`

**Solution:** Changed to correct variable `narrationChunks` (global state)

### Fix #3 - Split Regex Consuming Markers (2025-12-15) 🔥 CRITICAL

**Problem:** Original regex `/(?<=[.!?])(?:⚐\d+⚐)?\s+/` was REMOVING markers during split:
- Text: "Hello.⚐7⚐ World"
- Split consumed: ".⚐7⚐ " (entire delimiter removed)
- Result: ["Hello", "World"] ❌ marker lost!

**Solution:** New regex `/(?<=⚐\d+⚐)\s+|(?<=[.!?])(?!⚐)\s+/` splits AFTER markers:
- Pattern 1: `(?<=⚐\d+⚐)\s+` - Split after marker (keeps it in chunk)
- Pattern 2: `(?<=[.!?])(?!⚐)\s+` - Split after punct only when no marker follows
- Result: ["Hello.⚐7⚐", "World"] ✓ marker preserved!

This fix was the breakthrough that made the entire system work.

## Browser Compatibility

**Required APIs:**
- **Lookbehind regex** (`(?<=pattern)`): Chrome 62+, Firefox 78+, Safari 16.4+
- **CSS Highlight API** (`CSS.highlights`): Chrome 105+, Safari 17.2+, ❌ Firefox not supported

**Graceful Degradation:**
- If CSS Highlights unavailable: Highlighting disabled, TTS still works
- If regex fails: Fallback to text search highlighting (less reliable)

---

## Performance Considerations

- **One-time cost:** Marker insertion + DOM manipulation happens once per text block
- **TreeWalker efficiency:** Fast even with complex HTML structures
- **Regex complexity:** Lookbehind has minimal performance impact in modern browsers
- **Memory:** Temporary markers cleaned up, no leaks

---

## Recent Bug Fixes (December 16, 2024)

### Fix #4 - Upper Window Highlighting Missing 🔥 CRITICAL

**Problem:** Chunks in the upper window (like Anchorhead's Lovecraft quote) were not being highlighted.

**Root Cause:** The `highlightUsingMarkers()` function only searched two containers:
- Status bar (`statusEl`)
- Main game text (`mainEl`)

But missed the upper window (`#upperWindow`), which is used for quotes, formatted text, and ASCII art in many IF games.

**Solution:** Updated `highlighting.js` (line 16) to search three containers in order:
1. Status bar first
2. **Upper window second** (NEW)
3. Main content third

```javascript
const upperEl = document.getElementById('upperWindow');

// Try to find markers in status line first
let startMarker = statusEl ? statusEl.querySelector(startSelector) : null;
// ...

// If not in status, try upper window
if (!startMarker && upperEl) {
  startMarker = upperEl.querySelector(startSelector);
  endMarker = upperEl.querySelector(endSelector);
  containerEl = upperEl;
}

// If not in upper window, try main content
if (!startMarker && mainEl) {
  // ...
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Upper window chunks now highlight correctly

---

### Fix #5 - Leading/Trailing Whitespace in Highlights 🔥 CRITICAL

**Problem:** When highlighting text with leading whitespace (like `"                     A N C H O R H E A D"`), the system was highlighting all the leading spaces, creating large whitespace gaps in the visual highlighting.

**Root Cause:** Our HTML structure differs from other IF interpreters (like Parchment):
- **Our HTML:** Single text node with whitespace + content: `<span>                     A N C H O R H E A D</span>`
- **Parchment HTML:** Separate spans for whitespace and content: `<span>                     </span><span>A </span><span>N </span>...`

When using `selectNodeContents(textNode)` or a single Range for the entire chunk, we selected the ENTIRE text node including all leading/trailing whitespace.

**The Problem with Earlier Approaches:**

1. **Single Range approach** - Highlighted everything including whitespace
2. **TreeWalker with node filtering** - Skipped whitespace-only nodes, but nodes with content+whitespace still highlighted the whitespace

**The Solution: Character-Offset Ranges**

Use TreeWalker to walk text nodes, but create ranges with **character offsets** that exclude leading/trailing whitespace:

```javascript
// Walk text nodes in the chunk range
while (textNode = walker.nextNode()) {
  const text = textNode.textContent;

  // Skip empty nodes
  if (!text.trim()) continue;

  // Find content boundaries (exclude leading/trailing whitespace)
  const startOffset = text.search(/\S/);  // First non-whitespace char
  const endOffset = text.length - (text.match(/\s*$/)?.[0].length || 0);

  // Create range covering ONLY the content
  const range = new Range();
  range.setStart(textNode, startOffset);
  range.setEnd(textNode, endOffset);
  textRanges.push(range);
}

const highlight = new Highlight(...textRanges);
CSS.highlights.set('speaking', highlight);
```

**Why this works:**
1. ✅ Handles nodes with mixed whitespace + content (e.g., `"     ANCHORHEAD"`)
2. ✅ Uses character offsets within text nodes, not full node selection
3. ✅ Each range precisely covers only the visible content
4. ✅ No need to restructure HTML like Parchment does
5. ✅ Works with CSS Highlight API's multiple-range support

**Code Improvements (December 16, 2024):**
- Simplified container search with loop instead of repetitive if/else
- Cleaner variable names and reduced redundancy
- More concise comments explaining "why" not "what"

**Result:** ✅ Text highlights cleanly without any whitespace gaps, even with heavily indented ASCII art

---

### Fix #6 - Chunking Split Regex Missing Markers 🔥 CRITICAL

**Problem:** Sentences were being combined into single chunks instead of splitting properly. For example, "November, 1997." and "You take a deep breath..." were being grouped into one chunk instead of two separate chunks.

**Root Cause:** The split regex required whitespace AFTER markers: `/(?<=⚐\d+⚐)\s+/`

But in the processed text, markers often had no trailing space:
```
"November, 1997.⚐0⚐You take a deep breath..."
                   ^ No space after marker!
```

So the regex didn't match and the split didn't happen.

**Solution:** Changed regex to allow zero or more spaces: `/(?<=⚐\d+⚐)\s*/`

**Result:**
- Before: 8 chunks (markers 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 11 were missing)
- After: 15 chunks (all markers 0-14 present) ✅

Each sentence now correctly becomes its own chunk for TTS narration.

**File:** `public/js/utils/text-processing.js` line 55

---

### Fix #7 - Marker Insertion Reverse Loop Bug 🔥 CRITICAL

**Problem:** When multiple markers existed in the same text node (e.g., markers 2, 3, 4), only the last marker (4) was being inserted. Markers 2 and 3 were skipped, causing chunks 2 and 3 to have no highlighting or collapsed ranges.

**Root Cause:** After processing marker 4, the code updated `textNode = afterNode` (text AFTER marker 4). But markers 2 and 3 are BEFORE marker 4, so they were never processed.

The reverse loop processes markers 4 → 3 → 2:
```javascript
// After processing marker 4:
// DOM: beforeNode("...⚐2⚐...⚐3⚐") + end[4] + start[5] + afterNode("...")
textNode = afterNode;  // ❌ Wrong! Markers 2 and 3 are in beforeNode
```

**Solution:** Update `textNode = beforeNode` instead of `afterNode`:

```javascript
// Now correctly points to text containing remaining markers
textNode = beforeNode;
text = beforeNode.textContent;
```

**Result:**
- ✅ All markers in multi-marker text nodes are now processed
- ✅ No more collapsed ranges
- ✅ No more chunks bleeding into each other's highlight

**File:** `public/js/narration/chunking.js` line 158

---

### Fix #8 - Navigation Controls (December 16, 2024)

**Problem:** Back button behavior was inconsistent - 500ms threshold was too short.

**Solution:** Changed smart back button threshold from 500ms to 3 seconds:
- **Within 3 seconds** of chunk start → go to **previous chunk**
- **After 3 seconds** → **restart current chunk**

**File:** `public/js/narration/navigation.js` line 34

---

### Fix #9 - Highlighting Disappearing During Navigation (December 16, 2024) 🔥 CRITICAL

**Problem:** When using back/forward buttons, the highlight would flash then disappear.

**Root Cause:** `stopNarration()` was removing highlights by default when navigation stopped the current playback.

**Solution:** Pass `preserveHighlight: true` to `stopNarration()` in navigation functions:

```javascript
// Stop current playback but preserve highlighting (we'll update it next)
stopNarration(true);
state.currentChunkIndex = targetIndex;

// Update highlighting to new chunk
updateTextHighlight(targetIndex);
```

**Files:** `public/js/narration/navigation.js` (skipToChunk, skipToStart)

**Result:** ✅ Highlights persist smoothly during navigation

---

### Fix #10 - Chunk 0 Not Highlighted on New Page (December 16, 2024) 🔥 CRITICAL

**Problem:** When skipping forward during narration, chunk 0 on the new page wouldn't highlight (but chunk 1+ would).

**Root Cause:** Double-stop race condition
1. `addGameText()` stops narration → `isNarrating = false`
2. `handleGameOutput()` stops narration AGAIN (redundant)
3. `speakTextChunked()` checks `if (isNarrating)` → FALSE
4. Skips the 50ms delay meant to let old session exit cleanly
5. New session starts while old session still running
6. Old session interferes with chunk 0 highlighting

**Solution:** Remove redundant `stopNarration()` call from `handleGameOutput()`:

```javascript
// Don't stop narration here - speakTextChunked() handles stopping the old session
// properly with a 50ms delay to let the old loop exit cleanly
state.pendingNarrationText = text;

// speakTextChunked() will detect isNarrating and stop cleanly
```

**File:** `public/js/app.js` line 92-94

**Result:** ✅ Chunk 0 now highlights correctly

---

### Fix #11 - Session Supersession Cleanup (December 16, 2024) 🔥 CRITICAL

**Problem:** Even after Fix #10, chunk 0 would highlight briefly then disappear.

**Root Cause:** When old session was superseded:
1. Loop breaks cleanly (doesn't remove highlight) ✓
2. Falls through to cleanup code (lines 276-295)
3. Cleanup calls `removeHighlight()` unconditionally ❌
4. This removes the **new session's** highlight!

**Solution:** Only allow current session to clean up highlights:

```javascript
// Only clean up if this is still the current session (not superseded)
if (currentSessionId === state.narrationSessionId) {
  if (/* finished successfully */) {
    removeHighlight();
    // ... other cleanup
  } else {
    removeHighlight();
    updateNavButtons();
  }
}
// If session was superseded, exit silently - new session will manage it
```

**File:** `public/js/narration/tts-player.js` line 276-298

**Result:** ✅ Old sessions exit cleanly without touching highlights

---

### Fix #12 - Chunk 0 Visual Highlighting Timing (December 16, 2024)

**Problem:** Chunk 0 markers were found and CSS Highlight API called successfully (logs confirmed), but highlight didn't render visually on screen.

**Root Cause:** DOM layout timing - markers were created but DOM hadn't finished laying out when highlight was applied.

**Solution:** Add double `requestAnimationFrame` delay before highlighting chunk 0:

```javascript
// For chunk 0, add RAF delay to ensure DOM is fully rendered
if (i === 0) {
  await new Promise(resolve => requestAnimationFrame(() => requestAnimationFrame(resolve)));
}
updateTextHighlight(i);
```

**File:** `public/js/narration/tts-player.js` line 252-254

**Why it works:** Same technique used for VM start timing fix - ensures DOM is fully laid out before applying CSS highlights.

**Result:** ✅ Chunk 0 now highlights visually and persists during playback

---

## Known Issues (December 2024)

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - All major bugs fixed as of December 16, 2024

Previous issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Upper window highlighting
- ✅ Whitespace in highlights
- ✅ Chunking split regex
- ✅ Marker insertion in multi-marker nodes
- ✅ Navigation highlighting persistence
- ✅ Chunk 0 highlighting on new pages
- ✅ Session interference during page transitions

The system now works reliably across all container types, game text variations, and navigation scenarios.

---

## Code Quality Improvements (December 16, 2024)

1. ✅ **Logging cleanup** - Removed excessive debug logs, kept only errors and warnings
2. ✅ **Code simplification** - Streamlined chunking and highlighting logic
3. ✅ **Better error handling** - Added collapsed range detection
4. **Remaining:** Add automated tests for edge cases

---

## Summary

The temporary marker system successfully solves the highlighting problem by:
1. ✅ Preserving ALL original HTML formatting
2. ✅ Surviving text processing transformations
3. ✅ Enabling precise chunk boundary detection
4. ✅ Creating reliable DOM anchors for highlighting
5. ✅ Working correctly for complex game text (ellipsis, initials, paragraphs)
6. ✅ Modular architecture with lazy chunking
7. ✅ Multi-container support (status bar, upper window, main content)
8. ✅ Simple Range-based highlighting that works with CSS Highlight API
9. ✅ **STABLE:** All major highlighting bugs resolved (December 16, 2024)

**Key breakthroughs:**
1. **Split regex design** - Keeps markers within chunks, accepts optional whitespace after markers
2. **Character-offset ranges** - Use `setStart/setEnd` with offsets to exclude leading/trailing whitespace
3. **Three-container search** - Status bar → Upper window → Main content ensures all chunks are found
4. **Reverse iteration fix** - Process multiple markers in same text node by updating to beforeNode not afterNode

**Critical fixes (December 16, 2024):**
- Fix #5: Leading/trailing whitespace in highlights (character-offset ranges)
- Fix #6: Chunking split regex (changed `\s+` to `\s*`)
- Fix #7: Marker insertion reverse loop (changed `afterNode` to `beforeNode`)
- Fix #9: Navigation highlighting persistence (preserveHighlight parameter)
- Fix #10: Chunk 0 on new page (removed double-stop race condition)
- Fix #11: Session supersession cleanup (session ID check)
- Fix #12: Chunk 0 visual timing (double RAF delay)

**Architecture evolution:** The system has been refactored from a monolithic `app.js` into focused ES6 modules, improving maintainability and enabling new features like lazy chunking.

**Current status:** ✅ System is **STABLE** and working reliably across all IF game types tested (Anchorhead, Photopia, Lost Pig, Dungeon). All major highlighting and chunking bugs have been resolved.

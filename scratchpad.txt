DEPLOYING IFTALK TO FREE HOSTING
=================================

YES - IFTalk will work on static hosting options.

WHY IT WORKS
------------
- Node.js server is static file serving only
- Game engine (ZVM) runs entirely in the browser
- TTS uses browser Web Speech API
- No server-side processing needed


TO DEPLOY
---------
Just upload/deploy your public/ folder. That's it.

Netlify     - Drag public/ folder to netlify.com/drop
Vercel      - npx vercel public/ or drag-drop
GitHub Pages - Push public/ contents to repo, enable Pages


CHECKLIST BEFORE DEPLOYING
--------------------------
[ ] Game files (.z5, .z8) are in public/games/
[ ] All JS modules are in public/js/
[ ] Libraries are in public/lib/
[ ] index.html and styles.css are in public/

That's all you need - no backend required.
